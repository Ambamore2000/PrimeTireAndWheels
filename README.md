# STORY
As part of my Web Applications course, I worked in a team of 3 members to build an aesthetically appealing website for a potential client. Throughout the course, we were taught HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL to incorporate in our website. We also utilized Docker for our workflow.

# DEMO
Here is a link to a live demo of the website:
